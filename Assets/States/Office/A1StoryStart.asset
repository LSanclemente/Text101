  storyText: "\rIts a lone rainny night and I'm here half sober watching at an empty
    glass of cheap licor.\r\nThe room has a moody smell that reminds me that fall
    has already come and I don't even have money to pay someone to clean it.\r\nThen
    the door opens with a screaching sound. She enters the room like if it was hers,
    and I can smell the sence of trouble and fine perfume.\r\n\r\nWhat a man in my
    situation should do?\r\n1 - Sit straight and fake to be serious tone while asking
    her to sit\r\n2 - Ask her if she minds to share a cup or two before leaving.\r\n"
